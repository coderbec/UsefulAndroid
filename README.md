# UsefulAndroid
Library of useful android links, that I've discovered as I've learned.


## JSON

This is one of the better POJO generators I've found. It neatly formats everything into tabs and doesn't have all of the extraneous code annotations and what not that aren't relevant for android. My only complaint is that is has a habit of making things arrays, which should be ArrayLists, but I can forgive it for that.
